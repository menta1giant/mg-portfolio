## About project
I created my portfolio website to showcase my knowledge of React and NextJS as well as to offer a wider perspective on who I am as a person and as a software engineer.

Some of the key features of this project are:
+ Light / Dark modes
+ Internationalization using [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) (Russian / English versions)
